The scope of this project is to explore and enhance the Waste Recycling System based on exsting data that offers a glimpse into what is working and what is not working when it comes to waste management in the European Union.

# Data Sources

Eurostat is the main and only current data source for the data that is being used in this project. Given the large number of datasets available with certain specific topics, this allows me to explore many facets that might improve/affect waste management systems in Europe. The geographical availability is also an important factor that has contributed into choosing EUROSTAT as the main data source for this project.
